# Program to perform different set operations in mathematics

# define three sets
M = {0, 6, 4, 7, 9}
S = {1, 2, 6, 4, 5}

# set union
print("Union of M and S is",M | S)

# set intersection
print("Intersection of M and S is",M & S)

# set difference
print("Difference of M and S is",M - S)

# set symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of M and S is",M ^ S)

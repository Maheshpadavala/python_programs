                                                 Important questions for interview

1)What is string?
Strings in Python can be created using single quotes or double quotes or even triple quotes.
String is an sequence of characters.They are immutable,i.e,they cannot be change.

Assigning string to the variable.
a="This is a string"
print(a)
output:
This is a string



Is Python a compiled language or an interpreted language?

Actually, Python is a partially compiled language and partially interpreted language. The compilation part is done first when we execute our code
and this will generate byte code and internally this byte code gets converted by the python virtual machine(p.v.m) according to the underlying 
platform(machine+operating system).


3)Important differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x with examples

Python 3 syntax is simpler and easily understandable whereas Python 2 syntax is comparatively difficult to understand.
Python 3 exceptions should be enclosed in parenthesis while Python 2 exceptions should be enclosed in notations.
Python 3 rules of ordering comparisons are simplified whereas Python 2 rules of ordering comparison are complex.
Python 3 offers Range() function to perform iterations whereas, In Python 2, the xrange() is used for iterations.

4)How memory management is done in Python?
Python uses its private heap space to manage the memory. Basically, all the objects and data structures are stored in the private heap space.
Even the programmer can not access this private space as the interpreter takes care of this space. Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, 
which recycles all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space.


5)Scope resolution via LEGB rule :
In Python, the LEGB rule is used to decide the order in which the namespaces are to be searched for scope resolution.
The scopes are listed below:

Local(L): Defined inside function/class
Enclosed(E): Defined inside enclosing functions(Nested function concept)
Global(G): Defined at the uppermost level
Built-in(B): Reserved names in Python builtin modules.


6)What is list?
I
n list elements are saperated by commas and enclosed by square brackets.
List is an mutable datatype,i.e, we can change elements in the list.Lists are heterogeneous datatype it contains string,integer,float.

Methods in lists are in below: 

Append() Add an element to the end of the list.
Extend() Add all elements of a list to another list.
Insert() Insert an item at the defined index.
Remove() Removes an item from the list.
Pop() Removes and returns an element at the given index.
Clear()	Removes all items from the list.
Index()	Returns the index of the first matched item.
Count()	Returns the count of the number of items passed as an argument.
Sort() Sort items in a list in ascending order.
Reverse()	Reverse the order of items in the list
copy()	Returns a copy of the list


7)Difference between list and tuple?

list:
Lists are Mutable datatype.
Lists consume more memory
The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.
Implication of iterations is Time-consuming.

Tuple:
Tuples are Immutable datatype.
Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list
Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
Implication of iterations is comparatively Faster.


8)What is __init__() in Python?
Equivalent to constructors in OOP terminology, __init__ is a reserved method in Python classes. The __init__ method is called automatically
 whenever a new object is initiated. This method allocates memory to the new object as soon as it is created. This method can also be used to 
 initialize variables.


9)What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?
Identifiers in Python can be of any length.


10)What is PIP?
PIP is an acronym for Python Installer Package which provides a seamless interface to install various Python modules. It is a command-line
 tool that can search for packages over the internet and install them without any user interaction.
 

11)What does ‘#’ symbol do in Python?
‘#’ is used to comment out everything that comes after on the line.


12)How is Exceptional handling done in Python?

There are 3 main keywords i.e. try, except, and finally which are used to catch exceptions and handle the recovering mechanism accordingly.
 Try is the block of a code which is monitored for errors. Except block gets executed when an error occurs.

The beauty of the final block is to execute the code after trying for error. This block gets executed irrespective of whether an error
 occurred or not. Finally block is used to do the required cleanup activities of objects/variables.
 
 
13)Define encapsulation in Python?

Encapsulation means process of wrapping up of varaiable and method in single entity.


14)What is Polymorphism in Python?

Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms. So, for instance, if the parent class has a method named ABC then the child class
 also can have a method with the same name ABC having its own parameters and variables. Python allows polymorphism.
 
 
15)Does Python supports multiple Inheritance?

Python does support multiple inheritance, unlike Java. Multiple inheritance means that a class can be derived from more than one parent classes.


16)What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?

Following are the new features in Python 3.8 version:

Positional Only parameter(/)
Assignment Expression(:=)
f-strings now support “=”
reversed() works with a dictionary


17)What is swapcase function in Python?

It is a string’s function that converts all uppercase characters into lowercase and vice versa. It is used to alter the existing case of the string. 
This method creates a copy of the string which contains all the characters in the swap case. For Example:

string = "GeeksforGeeks"
string.swapcase() ---> "gEEKSFORgEEKS".


18)What is a pass in Python?

Pass means performing no operation or in other words, it is a place holder in the compound statement, where there should be a blank left and nothing
 has to be written there.
 

19)What is namespace in Python?

A namespace is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts.


20)What is a lambda function?

A lambda function is an anonymous function. This function can have any number of parameters but, can have just one statement. For Example:

a = lambda x, y : x*y
print(a(7, 19))



22)What is the difference between Set and Dictionary?

Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements.
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map.


23)What is the difference between Mutable datatype and Immutable datatype?

Mutable data types can be edited i.e., they can change at runtime. Eg – List, Dictionary, etc.
Immutable data types can not be edited i.e., they can not change at runtime. Eg – String, Tuple, etc.

 this process is called pickling. While the process of converting string representation into python object is called unpickling.
 
38)What is PEP 8?

PEP 8 is a Python enhancement proposal. It is a document that provides the guidelines and best practices on how to write beautiful Python code.
It promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style.

39)What is MRO in python?
--Method Resolution Order : 
Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other
 classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python,method 
resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a
class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO

40)Important differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x with examples
--In Python 2, print is considered to be a statement and not a function.
--In Python 2, strings are stored as ASCII by default.
--In Python 2, exceptions are enclosed in notations.
--The values of global variables do change in Python 2 if they are used inside a for-loop.
--In Python 2, the xrange() function has been defined for iterations.

Python 3.0:-
--In Python 3, print is considered to be a function and not a statement.
--In Python 3, strings are stored as UNICODE by default.
--In Python 3, exceptions are enclosed in parentheses.
--The value of variables never changes in Python 3.
--In Python 3, the new Range() function was introduced to perform iterations.

41)How memory management is done in Python?
Python uses its private heap space to manage the memory. Basically, all the objects and data structures are stored in the private heap space.
Even the programmer can not access this private space as the interpreter takes care of this space. Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, 
which recycles all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space.


42)Scope resolution via LEGB rule :
In Python, the LEGB rule is used to decide the order in which the namespaces are to be searched for scope resolution.
The scopes are listed below:

Local(L): Defined inside function/class
Enclosed(E): Defined inside enclosing functions(Nested function concept)
Global(G): Defined at the uppermost level
Built-in(B): Reserved names in Python builtin modules.

43)What is the use of with in python?
--with statement in Python is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources 
like file streams.

--without using with statement
file = open('file_path', 'w')
file.write('hello world !')
file.close()

--using with statement
with open('file_path', 'w') as file:
    file.write('hello world !')

44)Which modules you have been used?
--We have used different types of modules in our day to day deliverables.
  Paramiko, subprocess, winrm, openpyxl, JSON, nmap, re, time, requests, logging, random, pip, pylint, pprint

45)Explain about pytest?

-- Install pytest using pip install pytest
-- Simple pytest program and run it with py.test command.
-- Assertion statements, assert x==y, will return either True or False.
-- How pytest identifies test files and methods.
-- Test files starting with test_ or ending with _test
-- Test methods starting with test
-- py.test command will run all the test files in that folder and subfolders. To run a specific file, we can use the command py.test <filename>
-- Run a subset of test methods
-- Grouping of test names by substring matching.py.test -k <name> -v will run all the tests having <name> in its name.
-- Run test by markers.Mark the tests using @pytest.mark.<name> and run the tests using pytest -m <name> to run tests marked as <name>.
-- Run tests using py.test -n NUM where NUM is the number of workers
-- Creating fixture methods to run code before every test by marking the method with @pytest.fixture
-- The scope of a fixture method is within the file it is defined.
-- A fixture method can be accessed across multiple test files by defining it in conftest.py file.
-- A test method can access a Pytest fixture by using it as an input argument.
-- Parametrizing tests to run it against multiple set of inputs.
-- @pytest.mark.parametrize(“input1, input2, output”,[(5,5,10),(3,5,12)])
-- def test_add(input1, input2, output):
-- assert input1+input2 == output,”failed”
-- will run the test with inputs (5,5,10) and (3,5,12)
-- Skip/xfail tests using @pytets.mark.skip and @pytest.mark.xfail

-- Create test results in XML format which covers executed test details using py.test test_sample1.py -v –junitxml=”result.xml”
-- A sample pytest framework to test an API
-- Run tests in parallel
-- Install pytest-xdist using pip install pytest-xdist


46)What is the use of pylint?
--Pylint is used for the checking the good quality of code

47)What is meant by JSON module?
1.JSON ?

-- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation & we import the JSON package in Python script
-- It is used for storing and transferring data between browser and server
-- In JSON the text will be in double quotes as key-value pair within { }, it is similar to dictionary in Python
-- JSON Syntax - {"key":"value"}
-- JSON supports primitive types like strings and numbers, as well as nested lists, tuples, and objects 

-- Serializing/Encoding JSON(dump )? 

-- The process of encoding JSON is called serialization

    (1)To Convert from dictionary to JSON  -- json.dumps() method is used 
       Syntax : json.dumps(dict, indent)
	   
	(2)For Writing JSON to a file  --  json.dump() method is used
       Syntax : json.dump(dict, file_object, indent)

-- Deserializing/Decoding JSON(load)? 

-- The process of decoding JSON is called deserialization

   (1)To Convert from JSON to Python  --  json.loads() method is used
      Syntax : json.loads(json_string)
	  
   (2)To read JSON file  --  json.load() method is used
      Syntax : json.load(file_object)


48)What is File Handling?

-- Python supports file handling and allows users to read and write files
-- Each line of a file is terminated with a special character called EOL {,}

-- Working of open() : Before performing any operation on the file like read or write, we have to use Python inbuilt function open() to open the file
   Synatax : f = open(filename, mode)
   
-- There are different modes to perform the operations like:

    r: open an existing file for a read operation.
	Syntax : file = open("file.text", "r")
             print (file.read())
			 
    w: open an existing file for a write operation, if the file already contains data then it will be overridden. 
	Syntax : file = open("file.txt","w")
             print(file.write())
             file.close()
			 
    a: open an existing file for append operation, it won’t override existing data.
	Syntax : file = open("file.txt","a")
             print(file.write())
             file.close()
			 
   r+: To read and write data into the file, the previous data in the file will not be deleted.
   Syntax : file = open("file.txt","r+")
             print(file.write())
             file.close()
			 
   w+: To write and read data, it will override existing data.
   Syntax : file = open("file.txt","w+")
             print(file.write())
             file.close()
			 
   a+: To append and read data from the file, it won’t override existing data. 
   Syntax : file = open("file.txt","a+")
             print(file.write())
             file.close()

-- Using write along with the with() function:
   Syntax : with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
            print(f.write())
			

-- split() function using file handling: 
   We can also split lines using file handling
   Syntax : with open("file.text", "r") as file:
            data = file.readlines()
            for line in data:
            word = line.split()
            print(word)
			
			

49)Subprocess Module?

-- It is used to run new applications or programs through Python code by creating new process.
-- Popen() method is used to give the command and we will get the output.
-- It helps to obtain the stdin/stdout/stderr/return code as well as the exist codes of various commands
-- syntax: output = subprocess.run("ping www.google.com", stdout=subprocess.PIPE, encoding="utf-8", shell=True)
-- We have run method in subprocess:
   - First argument is input/command
   - Second argument is output of the command
   - Third argument is Encoding (bytes to string)
   - Next it will check the shell(as python program to execute this command on command prompt)
   - It will check whether it is stdout/stderr /return code 
   - return always should be non-zero, it means command executed successfully.
   
   
   
50)What is meant by GITHUB?

-- GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and helps us to work with others on projects

-- GitHub essentials are:

   - Repositories
   - Branches
   - Commits
   - Pull Requests/Merge Requests
   
   
-- Repositories:
   - It is used to store code/files to push/maintain/publish/review/pull code.  
   - It contain folders and any type of files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Documents, Data, Images
   
-- Branches:
   - A GitHub branch is used to work with different versions of a repository at the same time.
   - By default a repository has a master branch
   - Any other branch is a copy of the master branch
   - New Branches are for bug fixes and feature work separate from the master branch. 
   - When changes are ready, they can be merged into the master branch. 
   - If you make changes to the master branch while working on a new branch, these updates can be pulled in. 

-- Commits:
   - At GitHub, changes are called commits.
   - Each commit/changes has an explaination why a change was made.
   
-- Pull Requests/Merge Requests:
   - Pull Requests are the heart of GitHub collaboration.
   - With a pull request your changes will be merged (pulled in) with the master.
   - Pull requests show content differences, changes, additions, and subtractions in colors (green and red).
   - As soon as you have a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.   
   
-- Process in usage of GIT: 
  
   - git clone -It is used for downloading the code for first time
   - git pull origin main - It is used to get the added files/code 
   
***** To do any changes: 

   - git branch branch_name - We need to enter the repository name
   - git diff - It shows the difference
   - git status - It shows the difference
   - git add . - Adding your changed files
   - git commit -m "Date_"
   - git push origin branch_name

51)What is meant by Paramiko?

-- To transfer a file from local server to remote server & vice-versa using paramiko module in python
-- On windows to install paramiko use , pip install paramiko in command prompt
-- SSH is the method typically used to access a remote machine and run commands, retrieve files or upload files.
-- You can transfer files using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) and SCP(Secure Copy Protocol).
-- MAKING A CONNECTION : 
		import paramiko
		ssh_client=paramiko.SSHClient()
		ssh_client.connect(hostname=’hostname’,username=’username’,password=’mypassword’,port='')

-- Downloading a file from remote machine

		sftp_client=ssh_client.open_sftp()
		sftp_client.get(‘remotefileth’,’localfilepath’)
		sftp_client.close()
		
		
-- Uploading file from local to remote machine
		sftp_client=ssh_client.open_sftp()
		sftp_client.put(‘localfilepath’,remotefilepath’)
		sftp_client.close()


52)What are the levels in logging module?
--There are 5 levels of logging module
logging.basicConfig(filename="", level="", format="")
logging.debug()
logging.info()
logging.warning()
logging.critical()
logging.errors()


53)Why you are using random and what is the purpose of it?
--Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers. These are pseudo-random numbers means these are not truly 
random. This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random numbers, print random a value for a list or string, etc.

Example:import random
  
# prints a random value from the list
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(random.choice(list1))

54)What is API testing?
--API testing is a type of software testing where application programming interfaces (APIs) are tested to determine if they meet expectations for 
functionality, reliability, performance, and security. In simple terms, API testing is intended to reveal bugs, inconsistencies or deviations from the 
expected behavior of an API.

55)What is the purpose of git stash command in github?
--The git stash command saves a copy of your uncommitted changes in a queue, off to the side of your project.
--By uncommitted changes, I mean items in either the staging area or the working directory that have been modified but not committed to the local repository.
--Each time the stash command is invoked and there is uncommitted content (since the last stash command), git creates a new element on the queue to save that 
content. That content can be in the staging area, in the working directory, or both.
--After creating the stash and saving the uncommitted content, Git is basically doing a git reset --hard HEAD operation. However, because you have the stash, 
you haven't lost your uncommitted changes.

56)What are the difference between Match and search method in re module?
--The re.match () method finds match if it occurs at start of the string. For example, calling match () on the string ‘TP Tutorials Point TP’ and 
looking for a pattern ‘TP’ will match. The re.search () method is similar to re.match () but it doesn’t limit us to find matches at the beginning 
of the string only.

57)What is inheretance in python?
--Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

58)What is generator?
--A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than 
return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.

def simpleGeneratorFun():
    yield 1            
    yield 2            
    yield 3            
   
# Driver code to check above generator function
for value in simpleGeneratorFun(): 
    print(value)
	
59)What is decorator?
--Python can simplify the use of decorators with the @ symbol. This will output exactly the same, but is a cleaner way to write the code. 
The call In both cases we apply the decorator to a function. Parameters can be used with decorators.

60)What is iterator?
Iterator in python is an object that is used to iterate over iterable objects like lists, tuples, dicts, and sets. The iterator object is initialized 
using the iter() method. It uses the next() method for iteration.
 

__iter(iterable)__ method that is called for the initialization of an iterator. This returns an iterator object
next ( __next__ in Python 3) The next method returns the next value for the iterable. When we use a for loop to traverse any iterable object, 
internally it uses the iter() method to get an iterator object which further uses next() method to iterate over. This method raises a StopIteration to 
signal the end of the iteration.

61)What is __init__ method in python?
--The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the object’s state. The task of constructors is to 
initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of 
statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is 
useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.

class Person:  
    def __init__(self, name):  
        self.name = name   
    def say_hi(self):  
        print('Hello, my name is', self.name)  

p = Person('Mahesh')  
p.say_hi()  

62)What is meant by polymorphism in python?
--Polymorphism means basically many forms.
--The method should behave differently based up on inputs.


63)What is the automation?
--Automation Testing is the method of testing software products with special testing tools and frameworks to minimize human intervention and maximize 
quality.
--Automation Testing is done with the help of automation software, and it controls the flow of the execution of tests as per the written test scripts. 
--They are then compared with predicted outcomes to ensure the quality and reliability of the application. With Automation Testing, one can perform 
necessary repetitive tasks and those tasks that are hard to achieve with manual testing.

64)What is grouping in Regex?
The re.groups() method
This method returns a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match, from 1 up to however many groups are in the pattern. The default argument is 
used for groups that did not participate in the match; it defaults to None.  In later versions (from 1.5.1 on), a singleton tuple is returned in such 
cases.

65)What is difference between is and == operation?  
 Here we are going to tell you exactly what is the differences between these two operators are.

Assignment Operator (=)
= is an Assignment Operator in C, C++ and other programming languages, It is Binary Operator which operates on two operands.

= assigns the value of right side expression’s or variable’s value to the left side variable.

66)What is package?
A Package is a directory containing numerous modules and sub-packages, whereas a Module is a.py file containing Python code.
An __init__ .py file is required to create a package.
We can import all objects in a module at once by using the asterisk (*) operator but we can’t import all modules in a package at once.

87)So what do you look into the framework what did you do?

88)When you talk about the automation framework basically what is used for Automating the test cases?

89)Suppose you are running the test case it stops abruptly it stop how will you face?

90)While you are running the test case might stop for many reasons can you give me top 5 reasons?

91)For running the script before the script completed you run out of memory how you will solve
